# FAQ
- How can I earn coin?\
  By selling animals or animal's production (milks or eggs).

- I do no have enough money to buy animals and remove a grave.\
  It is game over. Now I am considering relief system.
  
- What is the production chance?\
Production chance indicates the probability of the animal's production of milk, eggs, etc. The pig's product is that it increases the growth of the surrounding animals.
Milk sells for a relatively high price, but the production chance is low, eggs sell relatively cheaply but have a high production chance, etc.
